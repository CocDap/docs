## Overview
Polkadot Agent Kit is a modular, open-source toolkit designed to simplify the development of agent-based applications and bots for the Polkadot ecosystem. It provides reusable components, utilities, and patterns for interacting with `Polkadot` and `Parachain` networks, supporting both core blockchain operations and higher-level agent logic.


## Purposes 

* Empower developers to build intelligent, automated agents and bots that interact with the Polkadot ecosystem.
* Abstract away complexity of multi-chain operations, transaction management, and agent orchestration.
* Lower the barrier for developers to build on Polkadot and foster a robust ecosystem of agent-based applications.
